											<h2>What is it? </h2>
										</header>
										<p>Imagine opening your favorite social media app like Instagram or YouTube. 
											Then you notice the amount of likes each video has. At first glance, 
											these numbers may seem random. But thanks to  extensive research done 
											by mathematicians, our initial guess of numbers being random might 
											not be true. If we take each leading digit of a like on a post, after 
											collecting a large enough sample we notice that small leading digits 
											appear far more often. Indicating that as the leading digits increase 
											from 1 to 9, the bigger the leading digit is, the less chance it has 
											of appearing. Giving birth to what is known as Benford's Law or or 
											the first-digit law. A pattern which can be seen across large datasets 
											such as video likes, bank balances or even city populations. Refer to 
											the graph below for a visual representation of how often each leading 
											digit appears.

									<!-- Newcomb / Benford info -->
									 <!-- class="content" to make paragrph in 2-->
									<p class="spotlight">The first person to point out this phenomenon 
										was Simon Newcomb. An astronomer and applied mathematician 
										who; in the year 1881 noted this phenomenon in his logarithm 
										books. He took note of the fact that smaller leading digits 
										appeared much more frequently than other numbers with larger 
										leading digits such as a 7, 8 or 9. His theory had a strong 
										foundation with evidence backing it up. But it wasn't until 1938 
										when Frank Benford decided to test Newcomb's theory and prove his 
										theory had validity. Frank Benford did a survey named “Law of Anomalous 
										Numbers” consisting of more than 20,000 data points from a variety of 
										sources such as the molecular weight of chemical compounds, address 
										numbers, population size among other things. By the end of his research, 
										he concluded the theory was indeed valid.   </p>

									<h2><b>Collecting Real life Data</b></h2>
									<p>I embarked on a journey motivated to see this mathematical theory for myself. 
										First I had to think about a pool of data with naturally occurring numbers 
										which span a wide range of magnitudes. This landed me on my instagram feed 
										and the number of likes on each post. Collecting more than 1,000 data points 
										which you can see organized in table below: 
									</p>
									
									<span class="image fit">
										<img src="images/likes_PD.png" alt="" />
									</span>
							

									<p>Once we have the data plugged into a graph we can see that it does 
										indeed follow Benford's law of natural progression. Coming pretty 
										close to the actual percentages which Benford's law followers. You 
										can see the similarity between both; My collecteddata vs Benford percentages: </p>

								<!-- result conclusion need to be shorten (and do a conclusion) -->
								<p>After extensive research and data points collected we can 
									conclude that Benfoird's law is legitimate. Furthermore it is part of our day to 
									day lives even if we don't notice. </p>

								<header class="major">
									<h2><b>Uses in the real world</b></h2>
									<p>There are real life uses for this law today. One of the main examples 
										is how financial institutions have used Benford's law in order to 
										monitor income tax, sales and payment methods. Let's say that someone 
										is trying to commit fraud by cashing void checks. We can assume that 
										if a person is going to write false checks, they wouldn't be for $100 
										or $200 but rather $800 or $900. If you do that enough times then the 
										natural order of numbers will be affected. Making it easier to spot 
										any fraudulent activity.

							<!-- result conclusion need to be shorten (and do a conclusion) -->
							<p>If you wish to learn more about this mathematical law discovered by Simon Newcomb in 
								1881 further examined by Frank Benford in 1938. Which has proven to be useful even in 
								today's day and age; where we use it to flag any fraudulent activity and make the 
								integrity of data within financial institutions more reliable. You can refer to the 
								links below. Benford's law is not just a unique mathematical property that is cool 
								to see in a data set, but it will most likely remain a key tool when it comes to 
								breaking down and  examining complex datasets.  </p>
