    <h1>BENFORD'S LAW</h1>
    <p class="author">created by Daniel Leal</p>
    <p>
        The principle that in any large, randomly produced set of natural numbers,
        such as tables of logarithms or corporate sales statistics, around 30 percent
        will begin with the digit 1, 18 percent with 2, and so on, with the smallest
        percentage beginning with 9. The law is applied in analyzing the validity
        of statistics and financial records.
